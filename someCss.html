	<h2>My thoughts on UW</h2>
	<p>Born and raised in Seattle I've always been fond of this city. It's a diverse city with a lot to offer in regards to employment opportunities, recreational activities, restuarants, and nightlife. With that being said, UW is situated in a great place. Although the school is rather difficult, I think the rigor of the courses challenge students to excel in ways they couldn't have imagined when they entered their freshmen year. </p>

<font face = "Comic sans MS" size =" 5">What do I like to do in my free time you ask? At UW I don't have much free time because all I do is study and sleep and it's a rather sad time. However, when the sun shines I enjoy running to various parks some of which include Gas Works, Greenlake, and the Arboretum.</font><br />
